Effective use of STL

1) STL containers

2) STL algorithms (more commonly used)

3) Theoretical understanding DS and algorithms

    Key : Attribute or the identifier for a data item
    e.g : employee ID is key for each employee object.
    hashing function is always applied on the key

    Hashing/hash function: Mathematical operation to determine the exact row (bucket) where each key and its related object will be placed.

    e.g: ID mod 4

    Hash/Hash value : Output of mathematical operation(hash function) applied on key
    e.g: 0,1,2,3 are hash values

    collision: Situation where hash function applied on 2 or more keys coincidentally gives the same value

    e.g: 203 mod 4 and 103 mod 4 gives answer 3 in both the cases

    collision resolution technique: Actions that can be taken to resolve collision 
        e.g: Linear probing, double hashing, open chaining etc.
