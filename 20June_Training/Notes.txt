THINGS NO ONE TELLS ABOUT DATA STRUCTURES:

a) Data structures are Arrangements of data, different ways of retrieving or accessing data

b) Data structures are theoretical and philosophical. They have to be implicated through code

c) Implementation of data structures on different platform or different libraries may differ in behaviour

d) There are "infinite" data structures in the world

e) Data structure Implementations have to follow rules/syntax of the language

valgrind --leak-check=yes ./app
