CPP is revised/updated every 3 years

so versions of C++ are: C++11, C++14, C++17...

    A -> Essentials of Modern CPP (fundamentals)
    B -> Functional programming in CPP
    C -> Concurrency and CPP17
    D -> STL Ds & Algorithms

Feature1: In class initialization
Feature2: Enum class
Feature3: Enable / disable special member functions
    -Defaulted and deleted member functions
    -you can choose whther to enable or disable 6 special member functions for a class you are creating

    a) Default constructor
    b) destructor
    c) copy constructor
    d) copy assignment operator = (overload = operator)
    e) move constructor (new feature in c++ 11)
    f) move assignment operator = (overload = operator for move)

Feature4: NULL has been replaced with nullptr

Feature5: Uniform initialization
    -we can initialize variables in a function using {}

Feature6: member list initialization

Feature7: auto keyword
            detect and infer the type of variables based on initial value

Feature8: constructor delegation
            you can transfer/shift control of the program from one constructor to another in the same class

Feature9: Additional numeric types with specific size in memory

Feature10: For-each (range-based for loop)

Feature11: Emplace data in containers (in-place construction of values within the container)
